In the refactored code, I have made the following changes in BookingController:

1. Removed unnecessary import statements.
2. Simplified the logic in the update method by using the except method to exclude unnecessary fields from the data array.
3. Simplified the logic in the distanceFeed method by using the null coalescing operator (??) and conditional ternary operators (?:).
4. Removed unused variable declarations.
5. Updated the return statement in the getHistory method to return null explicitly.

 Suggestions for implementations:
    1. Implement validation using form requests (e.g., BookingRequest).
    2. Utilize route model binding (e.g., show(Job $job)).
    3. Use Laravel's helper functions (e.g., $request->user(), config(), etc.).
    4. Implement complex business logics in services
